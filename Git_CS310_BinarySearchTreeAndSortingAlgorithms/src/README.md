## Project Description
1. In this program, I have implemented Binary Search tree and two sorting algorithms selection sort and insertion sort.
2. This program sorts elements of array 'a' using selection sort and insertion sort, then prints array elements.
3. After testing both sorting algorithms, program creates a Binary Search Tree and elements will be inserted into the tree.
4. Then, program will calculate the height of the tree for particular element and prints all elements of the tree by inorder traversal.
