## Project Description

1. In this program, I have implemented Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. 
In this implementaion, I have used Priority Queue for efficiently finding vertices with smallest distance from the initial vertex as well as I used Hashmap, Hashset and Arraylist for efficiency.
2. I have used multiple interface files, generics and incorporated several ADTs (i.e., Iterable, List, Priority Queue, Map).
2. This program calculates shortest path between first and last city mentioned in cities.csv file and it also prints graph details.
	 
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

 To run this program user required to have any Java IDE and git (Distributed Version Control System).

### Installation
I am using eclipse, java IDE and a web based git platform 'github.com'
1. Go to the following website
   https://ninite.com/
2. Select proper JDK and eclipse, then click on 'Get your Ninite'. 
3. Download and install eclipse and JDK.
4. Go to https://github.com/ and create an account.
5. Open a git perspective in the eclipse on your computer
6. Clone this repository into eclipse IDE using option 'Clone a Git Repository and add a clone to this view'.
7. Switch over to java perspective -> right click -> select import -> select 'Projects from Git' -> next
8. select 'Existing local repository' -> next -> JavaProjects -> next
9. select 'Import using the New Project wizard' -> click on 'Finish'
10. Java Project -> next -> Give project name -> Bowse the location of JavaProjects repository on your local machine 
instead of using default location -> Finish.
11. Run the project
